## Example Laravel4 REST backend

Little example application to test and learn about Laravel4 PHP framework. Including testing, routing, filters, db migration and seed.

## Develop

Waking up the app:

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan db:seed
    php artisan serve

Testing up if it's working:

    # List tasks
    curl -i --user test\@example.com:test localhost:8000/api/v1/task

    # Create a task
    curl -i -X POST -F 'title=Testing' --user test\@example.com:test localhost:8000/api/v1/task

    # Removing a task
    curl -i -X DELETE --user test\@example.com:test localhost:8000/api/v1/task


## Testing

``phpunit`` should do the trick. Testing is configured to use and in-memory SQLi db.
